Project Description/Outline
The video game industry is a multi-billion dollar industry, with gamers from around the world spending their time and money playing their favorite games. But, what makes a video game successful and what are ways we can define success for video games? 
The goal of our analysis is to examine various dimensions of success and find trends for the most successful games within those dimensions. Leveraging data from the Steam store, an online digital distribution platform for video games, we examined almost 75k games across the following success dimensions:  
Sales and revenue ($)
Metacritic score
Average playtime
Total owners per game
Number of positive reviews
Summary of Findings and Recommendations
Sales and revenue findings: From a sales perspective, it’s important to divide the games between free to play and paid games. For paid games, the games that made the most revenue were of the Action or Indie genre and developed and published by large companies, like Amazon, Valve, and Ubisoft. That said, looking at individual games, RPGs like New World and Elden Ring brought in the most amount of revenue. 
While it’s difficult to quantify full sales figures for free to play games using our data set, we looked at downloads as a proxy. Action, Indie, Adventure, and Multiplayer brought in the most downloads from free to play games. That said, Multiplayer games like Dota 2 and Counter Strike: Global Offensive stood out as individual games that had the most downloads. 
Recommendation: if we’re building a game that needs to be paid for one time, it’s likely we’ll bring in more revenue if we use a larger developer and publisher to create an Action RPG game. If we decide to go with a free to play model, we’ll get the game in more gamers’ hands if we create an Action Multiplayer game.   
Metacritic score findings: Free to play, Sexual content, RPG, Massively Multiplayer, and Indie games all have the highest average Metacritic score, however Indie games do fall just below the overall Metascore average of 72.8. Although they can have high Metacritic scores, games under the genres Nudity, Gore, and Violence have a high variance so can also have low Metacritic scores. For the most part, the more game owners you have, the higher your Metacritic score. That said, the games with the highest score are developed and published by companies that focus on one game or a series of games of very similar type. 
Recommendation: If we’re attempting to build a game that has a high Metacritic score, we should create a Free to Play RPG that contains Sexual content. But moreover, it’s most important that we focus on making one game great, rather than spreading ourselves thin with creating multiple games of different genres.
Average playtime findings: From the games to developers to genre groups, it’s clear that in order to get the highest average playtime, the game has to have some kind of practical, educational, or utilitarian purpose. Boom 3D, software that allows you to safely push volume beyond its regular limits, and Energy Engine PC Live Wallpaper, software that creates live wallpapers, had the highest overall average playtime at 2,429 and 1,737 hours respectively. 3 of the top 5 developers with the highest average playtime all develop software with utility purpose. At 613 average hours played the genre group with the highest average playtime is Utilities, Video Production, Web Publishing, and Game Development - practical tools for users.
Recommendation: If we’re attempting to build a game that users are going to play for the longest time possible, our game needs to have some practical, educational, or utilitarian purpose.
Total owners per game findings: The top games that have the most owners have between 50M and 100M: New World, Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, Team Fortress 2, and PUBG: BATTLEGROUNDS. Genres like Action, Early Access, and Free to Play had the most owners per genre. Larger companies like Amazon, Valve, or Krafton, Inc. had the highest amount of game owners across developers and publishers. 
Recommendation: If we’re trying to create a game that’s owned by the most amount of people, it’s best to create a Free to Play, Action game and work with a large company to develop and publish our game.
Number of positive reviews findings: Counterstrike: Global Offensive far and away has the most positive reviews of any game in the Steam database. However, when looking at genres with the most positive reviews, Indie games lead the way followed by Action, Casual, and Adventure games. Tags for Indie games had the most positive reviews followed by Singleplayer and Action. Valve, Hidden Path Entertainment had by far the most positive reviews for developers while Wallpaper Engine had the most positive reviews for publishers.
Recommendation: If we’re attempting to build a game that has more users leaving positive reviews, focusing on an Indie Action game seems like the most likely to succeed in this regard. Additionally, if we can work with the team at Valve, that could help increase the likelihood that we create a game with a high amount of positive reviews.
